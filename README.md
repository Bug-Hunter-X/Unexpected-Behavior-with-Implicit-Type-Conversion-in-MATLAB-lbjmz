# MATLAB Implicit Type Conversion Bug

This repository demonstrates a potential issue in MATLAB related to implicit type conversion.  The function `myFunction` illustrates how unintended type conversions can occur when mixing scalar operations with matrix/array operations.  The solution explains how to solve this using explicit type casting for safe and predictable results. This behavior can lead to errors when dealing with arrays or matrices, where the conditions might not evaluate as expected and result in incorrect computations.  The provided solution illustrates how to handle this by implementing explicit type checking and handling.
